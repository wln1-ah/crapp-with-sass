This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), then added [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) using the steps below:

1. From the root of the project run `npm install --save-dev node-sass`
1. Start (or restart) your front-end by running `npm start`
1. Either convert an existing style file to a sass file by adding an "s" to the beginning of the extension or add another sass file (remember to use the `.scss` extension)
1. Ensure that the `import` of that file into a React component file is either added (if a new file) or updated (if converting an existing CSS file to Sass)
1. Start using Sass to make your styling life better

_Note: this repository only shows the bare minimum of Sass's coolness--learn more by visiting Sass's website above or browsing the internet for tutorials on Sass_
